Cooling Case for Raspberry Pi HQ Camera and Raspberry Pi

I have been intrigued by the Raspberry Pi HQ camera since the time it was released. So much, that I bought three of them one after the another. I have been doing some astrophotography with the camera with quite decent results. I believe the limiting factor has been the lens that I have used and the barndoor tracker that I made and have used. I always wanted to try and cool the camera chip and see how it fares. It was cumbersome fixing a peltier with a heat sink and a cooling fan. The entire weight of these would be on the PCB and I feared it might get bent or damaged. I had fixed the camera and a RPi case on two sides of a small piece of plywood using spacers and screws. But again, the weight of the RPi and its case was all born by the PCB.

My focus for designing this case was on four things â€“ 
1.	Keep the weight off the PCB.
2.	Make it easy to fix a peltier for cooling the camera chip.
3.	Make it adjustable enough to avoid using peltier, but keeping the form and usefulness of the case.
4.	Make is easily mountable on various types of ball heads.
